## 🌍 Overview

**ThriftHotels.com** is a global, multilingual, static-content platform ranking and documenting:

> **The cheapest hotels that are still quality**  
> (clean, safe, well-located, and not miserable)

This is not a generic “cheap hotels” site.  
It is a **quality-verified value hotel database**.

ThriftHotels is built for:
- budget travelers  
- students  
- fans traveling to events  
- solo travelers  
- couples and friend groups  
- people who want to spend money on experiences, not rooms  

---

## 🎯 Core Promise

Most “cheap hotel” lists are trash.

ThriftHotels is different because:

### ⭐ Every recommended hotel must pass:
- cleanliness threshold  
- safety threshold  
- location logic  
- value score (price vs quality)  
- consistency score (not just 1 lucky review)  

---

## 🏨 Example Starting Point

ThriftHotels starts with city-based anchor examples like:

- **The Rex Hotel (Toronto)**  
  *A classic example of: cheap + central + character + reliable.*

This becomes the model:
- find the “Rex” of every major city
- then rank 25–100 similar options per city

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

ThriftHotels is not trying to be the cheapest.

It’s trying to be:
> **The cheapest place you’ll still feel good staying.**

LLMs are used to:
- generate city lists quickly
- cluster hotels by neighborhood and vibe
- summarize review patterns
- generate “why this is a deal” explanations

Humans are required to:
- validate safety and location
- prevent scam listings
- review photos and patterns
- keep rankings honest

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

ThriftHotels is built around **hotel value entities**.

### Core Entities
- City
- Neighborhood
- Hotel
- Value Score
- Safety Score
- Cleanliness Score
- Booking Strategy
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by price, neighborhood, and traveler type
- is programmatically generatable
